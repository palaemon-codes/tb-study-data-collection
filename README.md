# TB Study Data Collection Application

## üÜï **UPDATED VERSION** - Enhanced Analytics & Visualization Platform

A comprehensive Streamlit web application for cross-sectional TB study data collection in Chennai, featuring digital pathway mapping, advanced data analytics, and eHealth literacy assessment with fabricated sample data for demonstration.

## üè• New Features & Enhancements

### üéØ **Updated Delay Criteria Structure**
Completely restructured delay calculations to match clinical requirements:
- **Patient Delay**: Symptom onset ‚Üí First healthcare visit
- **Healthcare Provider-related Delay**: First visit ‚Üí Diagnosis confirmation  
- **Treatment Delay**: Diagnosis ‚Üí Treatment start
- **Total Delay**: Complete symptom onset ‚Üí Treatment timeline
- **TB Unit (TU)**: TB Unit-specific processing delays
- **Healthcare Providers**: Provider-related processing delays
- **No Delay**: Boolean flag for zero-delay cases

### ÔøΩ **Section 1: Streamlined Demographics** *(UPDATED)*
- **Removed excessive clinical details** for focus on core demographics
- Essential patient information: ID, age, gender, TB type
- Socio-economic profiling: education, occupation, income, residence
- **Simplified workflow** for faster data entry

### üìÖ **Section 2: Enhanced Digital Pathway Mapping** *(UPDATED)*
- **Specific delay reason analysis** for each phase:
  - Patient delay reasons (financial, awareness, stigma, etc.)
  - Provider delay reasons (diagnostic delays, misdiagnosis, etc.)
  - Treatment delay reasons (drug availability, counseling, etc.)
- **Improved date validation** with logical sequence checking
- **Real-time delay calculation** as dates are entered

### üìä **Section 4: Advanced Data Visualization & Analytics** *(NEW MAJOR UPDATE)*

#### üîπ **Multi-Tab Interface**:
1. **Current Patient Analysis**: Individual delay breakdown and insights
2. **Gantt Chart Visualization**: Timeline view similar to clinical workflow charts
3. **Data Analytics Dashboard**: Population-level statistics and insights  
4. **Sample Dataset Viewer**: 30 fabricated patients for demonstration

#### üîπ **Gantt Chart Features**:
- **Visual timeline representation** of patient care phases
- **Color-coded by TB type** and care stage (Pre-visit, Diagnosis, Pre-treatment)
- **Interactive timeline** showing 8 representative patients
- **Clinical workflow visualization** matching provided reference image

#### üîπ **Data Analytics Dashboard**:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, median delays across population
- **Demographics Profiling**: Age distribution, education levels, gender breakdown
- **Delay Distribution Analysis**: Histograms and box plots
- **TB Type Comparisons**: Delay patterns by TB classification
- **eHealth Literacy Correlation**: Digital literacy vs treatment delays

### üíª **Section 3: eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS)** *(UNCHANGED)*
- Complete 10-question eHEALS assessment
- Proper 5-point Likert scale implementation
- Automatic scoring and literacy level classification

### ‚úÖ **Section 5: Enhanced Verification & Export** *(MAJOR UPDATE)*

#### üîπ **Patient Details View**:
- **Complete current patient summary** with all calculated delays
- **Updated delay criteria display** (Patient, Provider-related, Treatment, Total, TB Unit, Healthcare Providers, No Delay)
- **eHEALS score interpretation** with literacy level

#### üîπ **Advanced Export Options**:
1. **Current Patient Export**: Individual patient data with complete timeline
2. **Combined Dataset Export**: Current patient + 30 sample patients (31 total)
3. **Sample Dataset Export**: 30 fabricated patients for demo/training

### üéØ **Fabricated Sample Dataset** *(NEW)*
- **30 realistic patient profiles** with varied demographics
- **Complete timeline data** for all critical events
- **Diverse delay patterns** and specific reasons
- **eHEALS score variations** across literacy levels
- **TB type diversity** (Pulmonary, Extra-pulmonary)
- **Realistic date ranges** and delay distributions

## üöÄ Key Improvements

### Enhanced Delay Analysis
- **Specific delay reasons**: Financial constraints, lack of awareness, stigma, healthcare access
- **Provider-related challenges**: Diagnostic delays, information gaps, empathy issues
- **Treatment barriers**: Medicine availability, test results, urgency awareness

### Advanced Analytics
- **Correlation analysis** between digital literacy and treatment delays
- **Delay pattern visualization** with color-coded insights
- **Benchmark comparisons** against WHO recommended targets

### Improved User Experience
- **Next/Previous button navigation** for streamlined workflow
- **Progress tracking** with visual indicators
- **Section jumping** for quick navigation
- **Real-time validation** with specific error messages
