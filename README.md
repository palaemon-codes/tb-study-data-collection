# TB Study Data Collection Application

A comprehensive Streamlit web application for cross-sectional TB study data collection in Chennai, featuring digital pathway mapping and eHealth literacy assessment.

## üè• Features

### üìã Section 1: Demographics & Clinical Information
- Complete demographic data collection
- TB type classification
- Symptom assessment
- Clinical history and comorbidities
- **Delay reason assessment** with specific causes

### üìÖ Section 2: Digital Pathway Mapping
- Critical timeline events tracking:
  - Date of symptom onset
  - Date of first healthcare visit
  - Date of TB diagnosis confirmation
  - Date of treatment initiation
- **Automatic delay calculations** (Patient, Provider, Treatment, Total)
- Date validation with chronological sequence checking

### üìä Section 3: Advanced Data Visualization
- **Horizontal bar chart** showing delay magnitudes
- **eHEALS Score vs Treatment Delay** correlation analysis
- **Patient delay reasons** frequency analysis
- WHO benchmark comparisons (7-day targets)
- Real-time delay insights and categorization

### üíª Section 4: eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS)
- Complete 10-question eHEALS assessment
- Proper 5-point Likert scale implementation
- Automatic scoring and literacy level classification
- Separate handling of supplementary vs formal scale questions

### ‚úÖ Section 5: Verification & Export
